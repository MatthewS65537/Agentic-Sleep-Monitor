## Recommendations

### Recommendation 1
-  Consider addressing your restless sleep at night. Implementing a relaxation technique like deep breathing exercises or meditation before bed could help promote a calmer transition into sleep.
-  Explore using white noise machines for consistent background sounds, potentially averaging noise levels between 30-35 dB. This can minimize disruptive noises and create a more conducive sleeping environment.

### Recommendation 2
- Sleep apnea can be managed with lifestyle changes like maintaining a healthy weight and avoiding smoking. If your AHI remains high despite these efforts, consult your sleep specialist to discuss potential treatment options such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).  

## Points of Concern
- The moderate increase in heart rate during the night could indicate possible underlying stress or anxiety impacting sleep quality. 


## Potential Issues
- Based on the AHI and Snoring data, you may be experiencing obstructive sleep apnea with a potential impact on your overall sleep quality. It's important to discuss this with your physician as early intervention can significantly improve your sleep health. 

## Further Action
- Consult with your primary care provider or a sleep specialist for a more comprehensive assessment and personalized recommendations.
