## Recommendations
### Recommendation 1
- Consider reducing total snoring time by evaluating sleep position; sleeping on your side may help.
- Keep track of any lifestyle factors that may contribute to snoring, such as alcohol consumption or nasal congestion.

### Recommendation 2
- Aim to increase deep sleep duration, as it currently constitutes only 25.1% of your total sleep. Techniques such as maintaining a consistent sleep schedule may be beneficial.
- Engage in relaxation techniques before bedtime, such as meditation or gentle yoga, to promote deeper sleep stages.

### Recommendation 3
- Monitor your apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) closely, as an AHI of 3.2 events/hour indicates mild sleep apnea; consider using a CPAP machine if symptoms worsen.
- Ensure that your sleeping environment remains conducive to sleep, keeping the room dark and quiet to minimize disturbances.

## Points of Concern
- The average snoring intensity of 48 dB is notable and may disrupt your sleep quality and that of a partner.
- The total apnea events of 24 could indicate a need for further evaluation, especially if you experience daytime fatigue.

## Potential Issues
- The presence of mild sleep apnea may lead to potential cardiovascular issues if left unaddressed.
- Insufficient deep sleep can affect cognitive function and overall health, potentially leading to chronic fatigue.

## Further Action
- It is recommended to consult a sleep specialist for a comprehensive evaluation of your sleep apnea and snoring issues.
